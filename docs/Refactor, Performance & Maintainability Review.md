CODEX Response:

Top 10 refactor / performance ideas

Centralize the ScoreBadge component.
The same badge logic is defined separately in App.jsx, FundTable.jsx, BenchmarkRow.jsx, and dashboard components.
Next step: create src/components/common/ScoreBadge.jsx and replace the duplicates with this shared component.

Move file parsing and scoring into a Web Worker.
handleFileUpload in App.jsx runs synchronous loops for parsing and scoring, which can freeze the UI when processing larger spreadsheets.
Next step: implement a worker that receives the uploaded file, performs parseFundFile and calculateScores, and posts the result back.

Virtualize large fund tables.
Components like FundTable render all rows at once, which could cause sluggish scrolling with hundreds of funds.
Next step: integrate react-window (or similar) and render rows lazily to keep DOM size small.

Simplify applyTagRules to a single pass.
The function currently builds several maps and then loops again to apply tags.
Next step: compute class averages in one reduce and tag funds in the same traversal to avoid multiple full-array loops.

Memoize heavy calculations in AssetClassOverview.
The component recomputes statistics on every render, scanning all funds each time.
Next step: wrap the classInfo generation logic in useMemo with funds and historySnapshots as dependencies.

Precompute statistics inside calculateScores.
For each asset class, the code extracts metrics and computes means/standard deviations separately for every metric, leading to repeated array traversals.
Next step: build a single pass that accumulates sums and sums of squares for all metrics, then derive means and std devs.

Trim verbose console.* calls in production.
Many components log debugging info during runtime, which adds overhead and noise.
Next step: replace these with a small logger utility that no-ops in production builds.

Create a dedicated utility for ‚Äúclean‚Äù symbol logic.
Several files implement their own clean or cleanSymbol helper when matching tickers.
Next step: add utils/cleanSymbol.js exporting a single function and reuse it across parsing, scoring, and tests.

Adopt TypeScript for services and components.
Files such as analytics.js and calculations.js are empty stubs, suggesting future work. Converting to TypeScript would catch many data-shape issues at compile time.
Next step: set up tsconfig.json and gradually rename modules (e.g., src/services/scoring.ts) while adding types for fund records.

Split large components for readability.
App.jsx currently handles file upload logic, tab navigation, snapshot management, and rendering over 900 lines.
Next step: extract feature areas (history view, snapshot comparison, admin forms) into their own components to reduce complexity.

Performance hotspots & quick fixes

File upload processing: heavy calculations in handleFileUpload block the main thread. Offload to a Web Worker so the UI stays responsive.

Large table renders: when filtering or switching views, the entire fund list re-renders. Introduce virtualization (react-window) or pagination.

Snapshot retrieval: getAllSnapshots loads and sorts every snapshot on each call. Cache the results or support pagination to avoid loading unnecessary history.

Repeated statistics calculations: computing class averages in multiple places (applyTagRules, AssetClassOverview, scoring) can be consolidated or memoized to reduce CPU cost.

Tooling upgrades

Add Prettier with a shared config for consistent formatting across the project.

Enable additional ESLint rules, such as react-hooks/exhaustive-deps and no-console in production.

Use webpack-bundle-analyzer or source-map-explorer to track bundle size and spot large dependencies.

Set up a simple GitHub Actions workflow running npm test and npm run lint to catch issues automatically.

Consider adopting TypeScript (supported by tsx) to improve type safety for services and complex data objects.
